        <p>I am learning <strong>HTML</strong>
             for the first time!
        </p>

        <p>The first thing I learned were about <a href="Strong_emphasis.html">Strong and emphasis!</a></p>
        
        <p><a href="Anchors.html">Anchors</a> are another important part of html that I learned about.</p>
         <p><a href="Attributes.html">Attributes</a> which are a part of anchors, is an important topic that is needed for HTML!</p>
